        <b> You will now start the Group Task.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this task, you will see two more paintings. Please select the artist who you think made each painting.
    </p>
    <p>
        You and your group members will be rewarded 100 tokens if more than half of your group correctly identifies the
        artist of each painting.
    </p>
    <p>
        You and your group members will earn an additional 100 tokens if your group gave the most
        correct answers.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will find out your payoff from Part 1 at the end of the experiment.
